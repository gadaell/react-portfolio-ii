            Salutations, my name is A'Darius Ellis, but everyone knows me as
            A'D. I attended the University of Memphis for my undergraduate
            career, and accomplished on receiving my Bachelor of Science in
            Health Science. I have been in the supply chain industry for 5
            years. I started my career at ABF as a dock worker, and eventually
            worked my way up to Operation Manager Asst. I decided to pursue more
            educated and decided to attend the coding Bootcamp program at
            Vanderbilt University provided by their partner, Trilogy. I am
            currently engaged to my beautiful fiancee, Amber, and we have a 1
            year goldendoodle named Shilo. Thank you for taking your time out of
            your hands to review my portfolio.
